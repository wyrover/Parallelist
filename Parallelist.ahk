; double check whether DetectHiddenWindows is necessary when using an hwnd
;wip: better error checking everywhere any functions.ahk function is called. assume each one is able to fail.
;wip: outputs should be in the same order as the inputs
;wip: restructure library into a class
;wip: restructure IPC to use sockets, so the library works over a network. have the design support multiple partitioners for better scalability. paritioning can be done with BucketIndex := Mod(Hash(Key),BucketCount)
;wip: periodically give out heartbeats to detect worker failures and close or cleanup the worker (or detect if it times out processing a task). the master server should log worker and scheduling state to storage periodically, so when master is restarted, it can read in the state again and keep scheduling. worker should wait if the master does not respond, and then send the data again when it receives the new master's startup ping
;wip: automatically start up workers based on available processing units. automatically close workers if they take too long to complete a task or stop responding to pings
